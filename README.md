## Purchasing Power Parity Explained
Purchasing power parity (PPP) is an econmic analytical tool that is used to compare the economic productivity of different countries.

The PPP is essentially an atypical exchange rate used to compare the value of different currencies in different nations. Purchasing Power parity is the strength a currency has when purchasing goods. If you have currency in one country and exchange it in another, how much can that value you get you of the same good. A standard example to easily understand this is the McDonald's Big Mac. According to the PPP if you buy a Big Mac in the United States then fly to a country in Europe that uses Euros , you should be able to buy a Big Mac with your converted US Dollar and the Euro should have relatively the same worth. Of course, due to many external factors affecting the currency in other countries this is not always the case. This leads to a fluctuation in prices in differenct countries
